# Raspberry Pi

Native systemd services; no containers:

| Name | Listener | Public URL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Caddy | TCP 80/443, UDP 443 | Automatic HTTPS and reverse proxy |
| Pocket ID | 127.0.0.1:1411 | https://id.threated.dedyn.io |
| Headscale | 127.0.0.1:8080 | https://headscale.threated.dedyn.io |
| Pi-hole | LAN TCP/UDP 53 | DNS blocking only |

Headscale's metrics and gRPC listeners are loopback-only. It uses the public
Tailscale DERP map for fallback relays. MagicDNS names peers under
`tail.threated.dedyn.io`; it does not override clients' existing DNS resolvers.

Run `just` from the repository to list deployment and secret-management commands.
